On January 6, 2021, a Joint Session of the United States House of Representatives

and the United States Senate (“the Joint Session”) convened in the United States Capitol (“the
Capitol”) building. The purpose of the Joint Session was to open, count, and resolve any objections
to the Electoral College vote of the 2020 U.S. Presidential Election, and to certify the results of
the Electoral College vote (“Certification of the Electoral College vote”) as set out in the Twelfth
Amendment of the Constitution of the United States and 3 U.S.C. §§ 15-18.
The Attack at the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021
5.

The Capitol is secured 24 hours a day by United States Capitol Police (“Capitol

Police”). The Capitol Police maintain permanent and temporary barriers to restrict access to the
Capitol exterior, and only authorized individuals with appropriate identification are allowed inside
the Capitol building.
6.

On January 6, 2021, at approximately 1:00 p.m., the Joint Session convened in the

Capitol building for the Certification of the Electoral College vote. Vice President Michael R.
Pence, in his constitutional duty as President of the Senate, presided over the Joint Session.
7.

A large crowd began to gather outside the Capitol perimeter as the Joint Session

got underway. Crowd members eventually forced their way through, up, and over Capitol Police
barricades and advanced to the building’s exterior façade. Capitol Police officers attempted to
maintain order and stop the crowd from entering the Capitol building, to which the doors and
windows were locked or otherwise secured. Nonetheless, shortly after 2:00 p.m., crowd members
forced entry into the Capitol building by breaking windows, ramming open doors, and assaulting
Capitol Police officers. Other crowd members encouraged and otherwise assisted the forced entry.
The crowd was not lawfully authorized to enter or remain inside the Capitol, and no crowd member
submitted to security screenings or weapons checks by Capitol Police or other security officials.

8.

Shortly thereafter, at approximately 2:20 p.m., members of the House and Senate

(including Vice President Pence)—who had withdrawn to separate chambers to resolve an
objection—were evacuated from their respective chambers. The Joint Session was halted while
Capitol Police and other law-enforcement officers worked to restore order and clear the Capitol of
the unlawful occupants.
9.

Later that night, law enforcement regained control of the Capitol. At approximately

8:00 p.m., the Joint Session reconvened, presided over by Vice President Pence, who had remained
hidden within the Capitol building throughout these events.
10.

In the course of these events, over 100 members of law enforcement were assaulted.

The Capitol suffered millions of dollars in damage—including broken windows and doors, graffiti,
and residue from pepper spray, tear gas, and fire extinguishers deployed both by crowd members
who stormed the Capitol and by Capitol Police officers trying to restore order. Additionally, many
media members were assaulted and had cameras and other news-gathering equipment destroyed.
The Oath Keepers Militia
11.

Members and affiliates of an organization known as the Oath Keepers were among

the individuals and groups who forcibly entered the Capitol on January 6, 2021. The Oath Keepers
are a large but loosely organized collection of individuals, some of whom are associated with
militias. Some members of the Oath Keepers believe that the federal government has been coopted
by a cabal of elites actively trying to strip American citizens of their rights. Though the Oath
Keepers will accept anyone as members, they explicitly focus on recruiting current and former
military, law enforcement, and first-responder personnel. The organization’s name alludes to the
oath sworn by members of the military and police to defend the Constitution “from all enemies,
foreign and domestic.” The Oath Keepers are led by PERSON ONE.

Case 1:21-cr-00028-APM Document 210 Filed 05/30/21 Page 5 of 38

12.

On January 4, 2021, PERSON ONE posted an article to the Oath Keepers website

encouraging Oath Keeper members and affiliates to go to Washington, D.C., for the events of
January 5-6, 2021, stating: “It is CRITICAL that all patriots who can be in DC get to DC to stand
tall in support of President Trump’s fight to defeat the enemies foreign and domestic who are
attempting a coup, through the massive vote fraud and related attacks on our Republic. We Oath
Keepers are both honor-bound and eager to be there in strength to do our part.”
13.

In his January 4 post, PERSON ONE also observed: “As we have done on all recent

DC Ops, we will also have well armed and equipped QRF 1 teams on standby, outside DC, in the
event of a worst case scenario, where the President calls us up as part of the militia to to assist him
inside DC. We don’t expect a need for him to call on us for that at this time, but we stand ready if
he does (and we also stand ready to answer the call to serve as militia anytime in the future, and
anywhere in our nation, if he does invoke the Insurrection Act).”
14.

PERSON ONE named PERSON TEN to be the leader of his group’s operations in

Washington, D.C., on January 6, 2021.

At a GoToMeeting 5 held on November 9, 2020, PERSON ONE told those attending

the meeting, “We’re going to defend the president, the duly elected president, and we call on him
to do what needs to be done to save our country. Because if you don’t guys, you’re going to be in
a bloody, bloody civil war, and a bloody – you can call it an insurrection or you can call it a war
or fight.” PERSON ONE called upon his followers to go to Washington, D.C., to let the President
know “that the people are behind him.” PERSON ONE told his followers they needed to be
prepared to fight Antifa, which he characterized as a group of individuals with whom “if the fight
comes, let the fight come. Let Antifa – if they go kinetic on us, then we’ll go kinetic back on them.
I’m willing to sacrifice myself for that. Let the fight start there. That will give President Trump

what he needs, frankly. If things go kinetic, good. If they throw bombs at us and shoot us, great,
because that brings the president his reason and rationale for dropping the Insurrection Act.”
PERSON ONE continued, “I do want some Oath Keepers to stay on the outside, and to stay fully
armed and prepared to go in armed, if they have to . . . . So our posture’s gonna be that we’re
posted outside of DC, um, awaiting the President’s orders. . . . We hope he will give us the orders.
We want him to declare an insurrection, and to call us up as the militia.” WATKINS, KELLY
MEGGS, HARRELSON, HACKETT, PERSON THREE, PERSON TEN, and others known and

WATKINS mentioned, among other things, that the militia had a week-long “Basic Training class
coming up in the beginning of January,” and told one recruit, “I need you fighting fit by
innaugeration.” In describing the program to PERSON TEN, WATKINS said, “It’s a military
style basic, here in Ohio, with a Marine Drill Sergeant running it. An hour north of Columbus
Ohio[.]”

2021, WATKINS replied, among other statements:

10

Case 1:21-cr-00028-APM Document 210 Filed 05/30/21 Page 11 of 38

I can’t predict. I don’t underestimate the resolve of the Deep State. Biden may still
yet be our President. If he is, our way of life as we know it is over. Our Republic
would be over. Then it is our duty as Americans to fight, kill and die for our rights.
and:
[I]f Biden get the steal, none of us have a chance in my mind. We already have our
neck in the noose. They just haven’t kicked the chair yet.
39.

On November 23, 2020, CALDWELL sent a text message to WATKINS stating:

Hi, CAP! Wanted to tell you it was great to have you here in Virginia. Don’t know
what [PERSON ONE] is cooking up but I am hearing rumblings of another Maga
March 12 December. 6 I don’t know what will happen but like you I am very
worried about the future of our country. Once lawyers get involved all of us normal
people get screwed. I believe we will have to get violent to stop this, especially the
antifa maggots who are sure to come out en masse even if we get the Prez for 4
more years. Stay sharp and we will meet again. You are my kinda person and we
may have to fight next time. I have my own gear, I like to be ON TIME and go
where the enemy is, especially after dark. Keep the faith! Spy.

Point still at your place?

CALDWELL: Not that I am aware. Have been contacted by NO ONE. Typical
[PERSON ONE]. Here’s the rub: [PERSON TWO] and I will be in
a hotel within striking distance of the city starting on the 4th so we
won’t even BE here. There will be some stuff going on during the
5th and we want to be a part of that whenever it shakes out. Also
we want to be in D.C. very early on the 6th, hence closer/virtually

WATKINS:

We planned on arriving on the 5th. We want to be in DC by 9am on
the 6th. I will reach out to [PERSON THREE], and see if NC boys
are coming. If [PERSON ONE] isn’t making plans, I’ll take charge
myself, and get the ball rolling. I think the Metro is smarter than
convoy/parking issues. Do you want us to stage ourselves vehicles
elsewhere, seeing how you’re going to be gone? We can go to a
KOA Campground or something...

...
CALDWELL (about two hours later):
Talked to [PERSON THREE]. At least one full bus 40+ people
coming from N.C. Another group (unclear if Mississippi guys) also
a bus. Busses have their own lane on the 14th street bridge so they
will be able to get in and out. [PERSON THREE] is driving plus 1
and arriving nite before. As we speak he is trying to book a room at
Comfort Inn Ballston/Arlington because of its close-in location and
easy access to downtown because he feels 1) he’s too broken down
to be on the ground all day and 2) he is committed to being the quick
reaction force anf bringing the tools if something goes to hell. That
way the boys don’t have to try to schlep weps on the bus. He’ll
bring them in his truck day before. Just got a text from him he WAS
able to book a room in that hotel I recommended which is on Glebe
Road in Arlington. However it goes it will be great to see you again!
I sure hope your arm is getting better!

fashion up the steps on the east side of the Capitol—each member keeping at least one hand on the
shoulder of the other in front of them.
133.

Towards the top of the steps, HARRELSON and DOLAN joined with the Stack.

134.

At the top of the steps, the Stack joined and then pushed forward alongside a mob

and the doors, and pulled violently on the doors.

25

Case 1:21-cr-00028-APM Document 210 Filed 05/30/21 Page 26 of 38

135.

At 2:39 p.m., ISAACS joined the crowd in forcibly pushing against one of the

Columbus Doors and the law enforcement officers guarding that door. Shortly thereafter, the
Capitol doors were breached by the mob, and ISAACS entered the building.
136.

PARKER, YOUNG, STEELE, KELLY MEGGS, CONNIE MEGGS, HARRELSON,
HACKETT, DOLAN, and the others in the Stack forcibly entered the Capitol.
137.

As they entered the Capitol, CROWL, WATKINS, SANDRA PARKER, YOUNG,

STEELE, KELLY MEGGS, CONNIE MEGGS, HARRELSON, HACKETT, DOLAN, and the
others in the Stack joined the larger mob in pushing past at least one law enforcement officer who
was trying to stop them from breaching the Capitol building.

PARKER, YOUNG, STEELE, KELLY MEGGS, CONNIE MEGGS, HARRELSON,
HACKETT, DOLAN, ISAACS, and the others in the Stack collectively moved into an area inside
the building known as the Capitol Rotunda.

PARKER, YOUNG, STEELE, KELLY MEGGS, CONNIE MEGGS, HARRELSON,
HACKETT, DOLAN, ISAACS, and the others in the Stack continued to communicate with one
another by keeping their hands on each other’s backs.
140.

At 2:44 p.m., WATKINS stated on the “Stop the Steal J6” Zello channel, “We are

in the mezzanine. We are in the main dome right now. We are rocking it. They are throwing
grenades, they are fricking shooting people with paint balls. But we are in here.”

26

Case 1:21-cr-00028-APM Document 210 Filed 05/30/21 Page 27 of 38

141.

An individual who had participated in at least one prior Oath Keeper operation with

WATKINS responded, “Get it, Jess.

Do your fucking thing.

This is what we fucking

[unintelligible] up for. Everything we fucking trained for.”
142.

Shortly thereafter, WATKINS, CROWL, SANDRA PARKER, YOUNG,

STEELE, and ISAACS exited the Rotunda through the northbound hallway and attempted to enter
the Senate wing of Congress.
143.

ISAACS yelled “the fight’s not over” and waved rioters down the hallways towards

the Senate.
144.

At 2:45 p.m. and afterward, CROWL, WATKINS, SANDRA PARKER, YOUNG,

and ISAACS joined the mob in pushing against a line of riot police officers guarding the hallway
connecting the Rotunda to the Senate, as WATKINS commanded those around her to “push, push,
push,” and to, “get in there, get in there,” while noting, “they [the officers] can’t hold us.”
145.

When officers responded by deploying a chemical spray, the mob—including

CROWL, WATKINS, SANDRA PARKER, YOUNG, and ISAACS—retreated.
146.

CROWL, WATKINS, SANDRA PARKER, YOUNG, STEELE, and ISAACS

regrouped in the Rotunda.
147.

At 2:45 p.m., KELLY MEGGS, CONNIE MEGGS, HARRELSON, HACKETT,

and DOLAN walked southbound out of the Rotunda and towards the House of Representatives.
148.

Meanwhile, CALDWELL, who was positioned on the west side of the Capitol,

joined with PERSON TWO and others known and unknown in storming past barricades and
climbing stairs up to a balcony on the west side of the Capitol building.

155.

While entering the Capitol building, MINUTA and JAMES pushed past Capitol

Police officers who placed their hands on MINUTA and JAMES in an unsuccessful attempt to
stop them from advancing toward the Capitol Rotunda.
156.

At 3:17 p.m., when MINUTA and JAMES reached the entrance to the Capitol

Rotunda, they joined with others in the crowd in a confrontation with a line of law enforcement
officers that had formed a barrier between the lobby and the Capitol Rotunda. JAMES yanked and
pushed several of the riot officers out of the way. While engaging in this conduct, JAMES
repeatedly yelled, “Get out of my Capitol!” and “This is my fucking building! This is not yours!
This is my Capitol!”
157.

As he stood behind JAMES while recording the events with a camera, MINUTA

yelled, “This is what’s bound to happen, just get out! Get out! Get these cops out! It’s our fucking
building! Get ‘em out, get out!”
158.

JAMES briefly breached the Rotunda but was expelled by at least one officer who

aimed chemical spray directly at JAMES, and multiple officers who pushed him out from behind.

At 3:19 p.m., while exiting the Capitol building through the same east side Rotunda

door from which he entered, MINUTA held up two fingers and yelled at a law enforcement officer,
among other things, “All that’s left is the Second Amendment!”
160.

At 3:22 p.m., JAMES exited the Capitol through the east side Rotunda door from

which he entered.
161.
