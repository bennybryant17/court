THIRD SUPERSEDING INDICTMENT

The Grand Jury charges that, at all times material to this Indictment, on or about the dates
stated below:
Introduction

The 2020 United States Presidential Election and the Official Proceeding on January 6, 2021
1.

The 2020 United States Presidential Election occurred on November 3, 2020.

2.

The United States Electoral College ("Electoral College") is a group required by

the Constitution to form every four years for the sole purpose of electing the president and vice
president, with each state appointing its own electors in a number equal to the size of that state's
Congressional delegation.
3.

On December 14, 2020, the presidential electors of the Electoral College met in the

state capital of each state and in the District of Columbia and formalized the result of the 2020
U.S. Presidential Election: Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Kamala D. Harris were declared to have won
sufficient votes to be elected the next president and vice president of the United States.
4.

On January 6, 2021, a Joint Session of the United States House of Representatives

and the United States Senate ("the Joint Session") convened in the United States Capitol ("the
Capitol") building to certify the vote of the Electoral College of the 2020 U.S. Presidential Election
("the Electoral College vote").
The Attack at the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021

5.

The Capitol is secured 24 hours a day by United States Capitol Police ("Capitol

Police"). The Capitol Police maintain permanent and temporary barriers to restrict access to the
2

Case 1:21-cr-00028-APM Document 127 Filed 03/31/21 Page 3 of 25

Capitol exterior, and only authorized individuals with appropriate identification are allowed inside
the Capitol building.
6.

On January 6, 2021, at approximately 1:00 p.m., the Joint Session convened in the

Capitol building to certify the Electoral College vote. Vice President Michael R. Pence, in his
constitutional duty as President of the Senate, presided over the Joint Session.
7.

A large crowd began to gather outside the Capitol perimeter as the Joint Session

got underway. Crowd members eventually forced their way through, up, and over Capitol Police
barricades and advanced to the building's exterior fa9ade. Capitol Police officers attempted to
maintain order and stop the crowd from entering the Capitol building, to which the doors and
windows were locked or otherwise secured. Nonetheless, shortly after 2:00 p.m., crowd members
forced entry into the Capitol building by breaking windows, ramming open doors, and assaulting
Capitol Police officers. Other crowd members encouraged and otherwise assisted the forced entry.
The crowd was not lawfully authorized to enter or remain inside the Capitol, and no crowd member
submitted to security screenings or weapons checks by Capitol Police or other security officials.
8.

Shortly thereafter, at approximately 2:20 p.m., members of the House and Senate

(including Vice President Pence)-who had withdrawn to separate chambers to resolve an
objection-were evacuated from their respective chambers. The Joint Session was halted while
Capitol Police and other law-enforcement officers worked to restore order and clear the Capitol of
the unlawful occupants.
9.

Later that night, law enforcement regained control of the Capitol. At approximately

8:00 p.m., the Joint Session reconvened, presided over by Vice President Pence, who had remained
hidden within the Capitol building throughout these events.

3

Case 1:21-cr-00028-APM Document 127 Filed 03/31/21 Page 4 of 25

10.

In the course of these events, approximately 81 members of the Capitol Police and

58 members of the Metropolitan Police Department were assaulted. The Capitol suffered millions
of dollars in damage-including broken windows and doors, graffiti, and residue from pepper
spray, tear gas, and fire extinguishers deployed both by crowd members who stormed the Capitol
and by Capitol Police officers trying to restore order. Additionally, many media members were
assaulted and had cameras and other news-gathering equipment destroyed.
The Oath Keepers Militia
11.

Law enforcement and news-media organizations observed that members of an

organization known as the Oath Keepers were among the individuals and groups who forcibly
entered the Capitol on January 6, 2021. The Oath Keepers are a large but loosely organized
collection of individuals, some of whom are associated with militias. Some members of the Oath
Keepers believe that the federal government has been coopted by a cabal of elites actively trying
to strip American citizens of their rights.

Though the Oath Keepers will accept anyone as

members, they explicitly focus on recruiting current and former military, law enforcement, and
first-responder personnel. The organization's name alludes to the oath sworn by members of the
military and police to defend the Constitution "from all enemies, foreign and domestic." The Oath
Keepers are led by PERSON ONE.
12.

On January 4, 2021, PERSON ONE posted an article to the Oath Keepers website

encouraging Oath Keeper members and affiliates to go to Washington, D.C., for the events of
January 5-6, 2021, stating: "It is CRITICAL that all patriots who can be in DC get to DC to stand
tall in support of President Trump's fight to defeat the enemies foreign and domestic who are
attempting a coup, through the massive vote fraud and related attacks on our Republic. We Oath
Keepers are both honor-bound and eager to be there in strength to do our part."

Overt Acts
Planning for January 6, 2021
30.

On November 9, 2020, WATKINS, the self-described "C.O. [Commanding

Officer] of the Ohio State Regular Militia," sent text messages to a number of individuals who had
expressed interest in joining the Ohio State Regular Militia.

In these messages, WATKINS

mentioned, among other things, that the militia had a week-long "Basic Training class coming up
in the beginning of January," and WATKINS told one recruit, "I need you fighting fit by
innaugeration." WATKINS told another individual, "It's a military style basic, here in Ohio, with
a Marine Drill Sergeant running it. An hour north of Columbus Ohio[.]"
31.

On November 9, 2020, WATKINS asked a recruit ifhe could "download an App

called Zello" 1 and stated, "We all use Zello though for operations."
32.

On November 17, 2020, when a recruit asked WATKINS for her predictions for

2021, WATKINS replied, among other statements:
I can't predict. I don't underestimate the resolve of the Deep State. Biden may still
gyet be our President. Ifhe is, our way oflife as we know it is over. Our Republic
would be over. Then it is our duty as Americans to fight, kill and die for our rights.
and:

1

Zello is an application that emulates push-to-talk walkie-talkies over cellular telephone networks. Zello
can be used on electronic communication devices, like cellular telephones and two-way radios.

[I]fBiden get the steal, none ofus have a chance in my mind. We already have our
neck in the noose. They just haven't kicked the chair yet.
33.

On Nove~ber 23, 2020, CALDWELL sent a text message to WATKINS stating:

Hi, CAP! Wanted to tell you it was great to have you here in Virginia. Don't know
what [PERSON ONE] is cooking up but I am hearing rumblings of another Maga
March 12 December. 2 I don't know what will happen but like you I am very
worried about the future of our country. Once lawyers get involved all of us normal
people get screwed. I believe we will have to get violent to stop this, especially the
antifa maggots who are sure to come out en masse even if we get the Prez for 4
more years. Stay sharp and we will meet again. You are my kinda person and we
may have to fight next time. I have my own gear, I like to be ON TIME and go
where the enemy is, especially after dark. Keep the faith! Spy.
34.

On December 3, 2020, YOUNG emailed the Florida chapter of the Oath Keepers

to make it wild!!! Sir Yes Sir!!! Gentlemen we are heading to DC pack your shit!!"
b. "Nice, we will have at least 50-100 OK3 there."

45.

On December 30, 2020, WATKINS and CALDWELL exchanged the following

text messages:
WATKINS:

Looks like we are greenlight to come to DC on the 6th. The Rally
Point still at your place?

CALDWELL: Not that I am aware. Have been contacted by NO ONE. Typical
[PERSON ONE]. Here's the rub: [PERSON TWO] and I will be in
a hotel within striking distance of the city starting on the 4th so we
won't even BE here. There will be some stuff going on during the
5th and we want to be a part of that whenever it shakes out. Also
we want to be in D.C. very early on the 6th, hence closer/virtually
no commute time.
WATKINS:

We planned on arriving on the 5th. We want to be in DC by 9am on
the 6th. I will reach out to [PERSON THREE], and see if NC boys
are coming. If [PERSON ONE] isn't making plans, I'll take charge
myself, and get the ball rolling. I think the Metro is smarter than
convoy/parking issues. Do you want us to stage ourselves vehicles
elsewhere, seeing how you're going to be gone? We can go to a
KOA Campground or something ...

CALDWELL (about two hours later):
Talked to [PERSON THREE]. At least one full bus 40+ people
coming from N.C. Another group (unclear if Mississippi guys) also
a bus. Busses have their own lane on the 14th street bridge so they
will be able to get in and out. [PERSON THREE] is driving plus 1
and arriving nite before. As we speak he is trying to book a room at
Comfort Inn Ballston/Arlington because of its close-in location and
easy access to downtown because he feels 1) he's too broken down
to be on the ground all day and 2) he is committed to being the quick
reaction force anfbringing the tools if something goes to hell. That
way the boys don't have to try to schlep weps on the bus. He'll
bring them in his truck day before. Just got a text from him he WAS
able to book a room in that hotel I recommended which is on Glebe
Road in Arlington. However it goes it will be great to see you again!
I sure hope your arm is getting better!
46.

On December 31, 2020, CALDWELL replied to a Facebook comment, writing, "It

begins for real Jan 5 and 6 on Washington D.C. when we mobilize in the streets. Let them try to

11

Case 1:21-cr-00028-APM Document 127 Filed 03/31/21 Page 12 of 25

certify some crud on capitol hill with a million or more patriots in the streets. This kettle is set to
boil..."
47.

On December 31, 2020, when invited to a "leadership only'' conference call on an

encrypted messaging service called Signal for the "DC op," WATKINS said she would try to make
it if her work obligations permitted.
48.

On December 31, 2020, KELLY MEGGS wrote a series of messages to another

person on Facebook that said, "You guys Gonna carry?" and "Ok we aren't either, we have a heavy

51.

On January 1, 2021, CALDWELL replied to a Facebook comment, writing, "I

accept that assignment! I swore to support and defend the Constitution of the United States against
all enemies foreign and domestic. I did the former, I have done the latter peacefully but they have
morphed into pure evil even blatantly rigging an election and paying off the political caste. We
must smite them now and drive them down."

5

Based on the investigation, QRF appears to refer to a "quick reaction force," as used in paragraph 43 .

then sent a link to the Comfort Inn Ballston, the same hotel that he recommended to others on
January 1. CALDWELL continued, "[PERSON TWO] and I are setting up shop there. [PERSON
THREE] has a room and is bringing someone. He will be the quick reaction force. Its going to be
cold. We need a place to spend the night before minimum. [PERSON ONE] never contacted me
so [PERSON TWO] and I are going our way. I will probably do pre-strike on the 5th though there
are things going on that day. Maybe can do some night hunting. Oathkeeper friends from North
Carolina are taking commercial buses up early in the morning on the 6th and back same night.
[PERSON THREE] will have the goodies in case things go bad and we need to get heavy."

CROWL exchanged messages about the hotel where they planned to stay in Arlington, Virginia,
and CALDWELL told CROWL: "This is a good location and would allow us to hunt at night if
we wanted to. I don't know if [PERSON ONE] has even gotten out his call to arms but its a little
friggin late. This is one we are doing on our own. We will link up with the north carolina crew."
56.

we have probable cause for acts of treason, election fraud." WATKINS responded,
"We are in the mezzanine. We are in the main dome right now. We are rocking it.

we are in here." An individual responded to WATKINS, telling her to be safe, and
stated, "Get it, Jess. Do your fucking thing. This is what we fucking [unintelligible]
up for. Everything we fucking trained for."
